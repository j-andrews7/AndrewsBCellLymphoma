  - title: "RNA-seq analysis"
    desc: >
      Functions that perform DESeq2 analyses, utilizing the utility and plotting functions to generate output tables and figures. 
      These are the crux of the RNA-seq portion of the package and what most users should use.

  - title: "RNA-seq Plotting"
    desc: >
      Functions that generate plots for RNA-seq data. Calling these individually can sometimes be useful.

  - title: "ChIP-seq analysis"
    desc: >
      Functions that perform ChIPQC/DiffBind analyses, utilizing the utility and plotting functions to generate output tables and figures. 
      These are the crux of the ChIP-seq portion of the package and what most users should use.

  - title: "Enrichment Analyses"
    desc: >
      This function performs GO/pathway enrichment analysis for lists of genes resulting from both RNA and ChIP-seq analyses.
    contents:
      - PlotEnrichments
  - title: "Internal utilities"
    desc: Functions used to create directory structure and save output. Users shouldn't need to call these explicitely.
